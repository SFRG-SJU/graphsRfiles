## Instructions for GitHub (Mac) (DO NOT IMPLEMENT FOR NOW)
Brian's Instructions:

To clone this repository on your local machine (Mac):

Install git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Create ssh private/public keys (for Mac). In the terminal, type this, replacing YOUR EMAIL:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C “YOUR EMAIL"

Keep pressing enter ask it asks for location and passphrase. From the terminal, run:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy and paste everything that is output (from ssh-rsa to your email address).

Go to GitHub.com, click your avatar in the top right, Settings, then click “SSH and GPG keys” on the left side of the screen. 

Click “New SSH key” and paste the key into the big box. 
The title can be anything, and it is linked to your computer. 

Click “Add SSH Key.” Now go to terminal and run:

ssh git@github.com

If necessary, type “y” to continue connecting. 
You should get a message that you have successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. This is ok.

Now, to download the repository, go to terminal, use cd to change to the directory where you want to store the repository (on a Mac, you can type cd, then drag the folder to the terminal window), and run:

git clone ssh://git@github.com/SFRG-SJU/graphsRfiles

This should create a copy of the repository in a folder called “graphsRfiles” in whichever directory you had the terminal pointed to when you executed it.
